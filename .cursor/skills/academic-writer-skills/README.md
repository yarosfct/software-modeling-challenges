## Installation

### Claude Code

```bash
claude plugin install academic-writer
```

Or selective install by profile:

```bash
# Core (5 essential skills)
./install.sh --profile=core

# Researcher (15 skills, recommended)
./install.sh --profile=researcher

# Full (all 27 skills)
./install.sh --profile=full
```

### Gemini CLI

```bash
# Load all context and skills
gemini -p @GEMINI.md "Write a structured abstract for my paper on [topic]"

# Load with writing mode context
gemini -p @contexts/writing.md @GEMINI.md "Help me structure my research paper"

# See the full Gemini guide
cat GEMINI.md
```

### Cursor IDE

Copy `.cursorrules` to your project root:

```bash
cp .cursorrules /path/to/your/project/.cursorrules
```

Or symlink for automatic updates:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/academic-writer-skills/.cursorrules /path/to/your/project/.cursorrules
```

### Node.js Installer

```bash
# See what will be installed
node scripts/install-plan.js

# Install researcher profile (default)
node scripts/install.js

# Install specific profile
node scripts/install.js --profile=full

# Dry run to preview
node scripts/install.js --profile=full --dry-run

# Install specific skills
node scripts/install.js --skills=grant-proposal,statistical-reporting
```

## Quick Start

### Claude Code

After installation:

```
write my paper on climate adaptation in coastal cities
help me format my references in APA style
I need to respond to peer reviewers — here are their comments: [paste]
write my NIH Specific Aims page for a study on [topic]
```

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini -p @GEMINI.md "Help me write a literature review on [topic]"
gemini -p @GEMINI.md "Format this citation in Chicago style: [paste citation]"
gemini -p @GEMINI.md "Is this journal predatory? [journal name]"
```

### Cursor IDE

Open any `.tex`, `.md`, or paper file in Cursor. With `.cursorrules` in your project, Cursor will automatically activate academic writing mode and route to appropriate skill behaviors.
