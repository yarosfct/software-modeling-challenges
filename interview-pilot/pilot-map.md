# Interview Pilot - Software Modelling (Students and Teachers)

## Goals

### What do I want to understand?

- How people experience software/conceptual modelling (UML, BPMN, iStar, ER, etc)
- What they find hard / easy / valuable / pointless.
- How they think about learning outcomes / competencies
- Which teaching strategies, tools, domains, assignments help or hinder.
- Ideas / requirements for better support 

### Style

- Semi-structured: I should have a backbone of questions, but it is better to follow interesting threads.
- Open and non-judgmental: no right/wrong answers.
- Grounded-theory-friendly:
  - Start broad (like "tell me about ...")
  - Use probing ("can you give me an example?")
  - Stay as close as possible to the participants own words.


## Generic intro for both groups - 2/3 min 


- Thank the participant for taking their time to do the interview.
- Give some context about the interview background, like, "im working on a thesis about ...,"
- Explain why you picked that person for the interview : "im interested in your experience with ..., what works, what doesnt, what would help with ..."
- Then inform the participant about the expected/approcimated duration of the interview, inform that you will be taking notes or even recording audio, therefore getting the interview consent is priority ("if you are okay with, ill be ...").
- Assure the interviewer that his/her identity will remain anonymised, " i wont use your name or anything that directly identifies you in the thesis".
- Reasure the interviewer that there are no right or wrong answer and what im really looking for is honest opinions, that the interviewer is allowed and encouraged to make questions if anything is unclear, and if by chance there is some question that the interviewer doesnt want to answer, he can just say no.
- Lastly ask the interviewer if he got any questions before starting, and after that, ask permission for recording and start the interview.

## Follow up prompts that can be useful

Whenever someone says something intersting, this can be used as generic probes:

- "Can you tell me a bit more about that?"
- "What do you mean by [their word] in this context?"
- "Can you give me a concrete example?"
- "How did you feel in that situation?"
- "What made that particularly easy/hard/frustrating...?"
- "How did you deal with that at the time?"
- "If you could change something about that, what would it be?"
- "Has this happened more than once? When else?"
- ... I'll add more later
