# Domain Modelling in Bloom

## What is this paper about and why it matters (Intro - Sec. 1)

- **Domain modeling** = the "what/data" perspective f enterprise modeling (objects, classes, attributes, associations, inheritance, etc), and it's seen as **crucial but hard** in enterprise engineering education.
- Teaching domain modeling is problematic because:
  1. **Ill-Structured problems:** students must model messy natural-language descriptions in diverse domain (software, engineering, enterprise).
  2. **No common pedagogy:** teachers design tasks and learning paths based on personal experience -> huge variation in methods and sequencing.
  3. **Terminology chaos** ("Babylonian" state): same concepts named differently in different communities (OO, DB, Conceptual modeling), which hampers knowledge transfer.
  4. **Unclear picture of a "good modeler**: skill set and learning outcomes are not formalized, so its hard to design proper assessments and scaffolding.

**Goal of the Paper:**
- Take a **concrete slice of CM education** (domain modeling) and:
  - Identify **learning outcomes** used in practice (books, MOOCs, exams),
  - classify them using **revised Bloom's taxonomy**,
  - see how domain modeling is scaffolded,
  - detect **gaps**(e.g., missing cognitive/knowledge levels, missing steps in scaffolding).

This is directly relevant to the thesis because:
- Shows how Bloom can be specialized to modeling.
- Empirically exposes **where teaching and assessment are unbalanced** (e.g., lots of "create" tasks but little evaluation/procedural/metacognitive).

## Bloom's Taxonomy Adapted to Domain Modeling (Method - Sec. 3.1)

The authoes tailor the revised blooms taxonomy (cognitive x knowledge) specifically for domain modeling:

### Cognitive process levels (with domain-modeling examples) - Sec. 3.1

- **Remember** - recall notation and definitions
  - e.g., "Define inheritance", "Name this UML element"
- **Understand**- interpret or explain models
  - e.g. "Explain this class diagram in text", "Give an instance/example of a class or association."
- **Apply**- use learned techniques
  - e.g. "Modify this model to include a new association."
- **Analyze**- decompose and compare models
  - e.g. "Compare two models for the same domain", "Generalize a model"
- **Evaluate**- judge models against criteria
  - e.g. "Find mistakes in this model based on the description", "Choose the best model and justifyy"
- **Create**- build or significantly extend models
  - e.g. "Build a domain model from a requirements text", "Complete an incomplete model".

### Knowledge levels (domain-modeling interpretations) - Sec. 3.1

- **Factual** - terminology and notation (names of constructs)
- **Conceptual** - how modeling concepts relate (e.g., how inheritance vs aggregation vs association differ)
- **Procedural** - methods, rules, modeling strategies and guidelines (step-by-step approaches, modeling heuristics)
- **Metacognitive** - awareness of one's own typical mistakes, strategies for learning/improving modeling.

### Usefulness

This can give me a ready-made definitions if I need/want to build a Bloom-based framework for modeling learning outcomes.
